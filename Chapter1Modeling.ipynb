        "Modeling is an important task in mathematics, computer science and science in general.  It is the process of breaking down a complex problem or situation and converting it into something that can be manipulated with equations.  In terms most fifth graders would know, it is solving word problems!\n",
        "\n",
        "Following Dr. Polya, we consider 4 steps to solving any mathematical problem\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ***Understand*** the problem and clearly see what is required\n",
        "2. ***Plan*** how the unknown is linked to the data\n",

        "4. ***Look Back*** at our solution and ask did it solve our original problem\n",
